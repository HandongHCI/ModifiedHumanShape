The L-BFGS-B website requests that you cite them. From their website:
"Condition for Use: This software is freely available, but we expect that all publications describing  work using this software , or all commercial products using it, quote at least one of the references given below. This software is released under the "New BSD License" (aka "Modified BSD License" or "3-clause license"). "

It would be nice to cite this website as well since it took a significant amount of work...
